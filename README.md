Collaborative project between the UAL BA (Hons) Games Design course and the BA (Hons) Games Art course. Consisting of a team of 4 students from each course (Including me). Assets were designed by the Games Art course, while the Games Design course created the game itself. I served as Animator and Assistant Programmer on the project, developing the game's early prototypes and animating everything.
