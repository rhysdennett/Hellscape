Collaborative project between UAL BA (Hons) Games Design course and BA (Hons) Games Art course. Consisting of a team of 4 students from each course (Including me). Assets were designed by the Games Art course while the game itself was created by the Games design course. I served as Animator and Assistant Programmer on the project, developing the games early prototypes and animating everything.
